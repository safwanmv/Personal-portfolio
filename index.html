                    I'm an aspiring front-end developer passionate about building clean, responsive websites using HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. I recently completed my BCA degree from Calicut University
                    and am currently focused on mastering front-end development. My goal is to become a full-stack web
                    developer, and after strengthening my front-end skills, I plan to dive into backend technologies as
                    well. I'm actively exploring opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and learn in a professional
                    development environment. </p>

                        <p>Counter App is a beginner-friendly yet insightful project that introduces essential concepts
                            of modern front-end development using React.js. This interactive application allows users to
                            increment, decrement, and reset a counter value in real time. Built with a focus on reusable
                            components and clean code structure, the app demonstrates mastery of JSX syntax,
                            component-based architecture, and the useState hook for state management. Styling was
                            achieved using custom CSS, including hover effects to enhance user experience. The project
                            serves as a strong foundation for understanding the core principles of React, such as
                            declarative UI updates and separation of concerns. With its simple yet practical
                            functionality, the Counter App is ideal for developers starting out with React and offers
                            room for further enhancements like themes, animations, or custom step values.</p>

                        <p>Weather App is a dynamic and user-centric application that displays real-time weather
                            information for any city using the WeatherAPI. Developed with React.js, the app demonstrates
                            key skills such as asynchronous data fetching with async/await, effective use of useState
                            for managing state, and conditional rendering for user-friendly updates. It features clean
                            UI components, proper error handling for invalid inputs, and loading indicators to enhance
                            the user experience. The application fetches current weather data including temperature,
                            condition, and location, providing a practical demonstration of working with third-party
                            APIs. This project helped strengthen foundational React concepts and serves as a valuable
                            example of building interactive, API-driven single-page applications. Opportunities for
                            further enhancement include adding a 5-day forecast, theme toggling, and responsive design.

                        <p>Memory Game is an engaging, browser-based game built from scratch to strengthen core
                            JavaScript concepts and front-end interactivity. The game challenges users to match pairs of
                            hidden cards, testing both logic and memory skills. Developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla
                            JavaScript, it leverages advanced techniques like higher-order functions, closures, and
                            modern ES6 syntax such as arrow functions and spread/rest operators. Key features include
                            dynamic DOM manipulation, smooth event handling, and real-time game logic for score tracking
                            and state resets. The game interface is fully interactive, providing immediate visual
                            feedback and styled transitions. This project not only reinforces deep JavaScript mastery
                            but also introduces the fundamentals of game development within a web environment, making it
                            both educational and entertaining.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Blog Website</h4>
                        <p>Blog Website is a multi-page static application developed using React.js to demonstrate
                            seamless navigation and efficient state sharing across components. The project features a
                            dynamic routing system implemented with react-router-dom, allowing users to navigate between
                            different blog pages without reloading the site. It also utilizes the useContext hook to
                            manage and distribute global state such as user preferences or blog data, enabling
                            consistent UI updates across components. The layout includes reusable components like a
                            navigation bar, footer, and content sections, promoting clean architecture and
                            maintainability. This project significantly improved understanding of component composition,
                            routing logic, and centralized state management in React, while laying the groundwork for
                            building more scalable, single-page applications in the future.</p>
